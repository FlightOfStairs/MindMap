amzn.description=Worked on a team responsible for real-time services used by Amazon. Agile practises are widely used.
dstl.description=Worked as a member of a small software department. I had a great deal of freedom to design and implement solutions as I chose. Technologies I used included C#, Java, Python, Haskell, Evolutionary computation, and Trusted Computing. Areas of work included analysis of large datasets, creating tools to work with program disassembles, and recovering missing data through stochastic methods.
epsrc.description=The subject was "Capturing Task Related Knowledge." I worked largely independently to explore ways of finding other resources relevant to the set of resources currently being used. I learned and gained experience on how to manage a medium-sized software project from start to finish.

uni.description=Secured a 10-week paid research internship over the summer 2009, have demonstrated my coursework to university applicants at open days in 2nd, 3rd and 4th years, and was a lab demonstrator for 1st and 3rd year classes.
